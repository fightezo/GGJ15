The Good the Bad and the Ugly [GGJ15]
=====
Game created during the 2015 GGJ. That year's theme was “What do we do now?”. We came up with the idea of a wild west trio
trying get out of town by either earning enough money, or assassinating the opponent. This turn-based game reflects upon the
players decision on what the player's going to do at that instance.
